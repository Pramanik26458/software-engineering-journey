    <h1>Arrays-</h1>
    <p>
      An array is a data structure that can hold more than one value at a time.
      It is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The
      idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it
      easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an
      offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of
      the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).
