# Software Engineering Journey

This repository is a record of my learning and hands-on work as I grow into a software engineer.

I created this repo to keep my practice, experiments, and projects in one place — from core fundamentals to more advanced concepts — and to track my progress through real code.

---

## What this repository contains

- Frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- React and modern UI development  
- Backend development with Node.js, Express, and databases  
- Basic DevOps and deployment concepts  
- Explorations in AI / Generative AI  
- Foundational Web3 concepts  

Each section reflects what I’m learning at that stage and includes practice code, small experiments, and projects.

## Why I built this repository

I wanted a place that shows:
- How I approach learning  
- How I organize and write code  
- How my understanding improves over time  

This repository is not meant to be perfect.  
It’s a **work in progress**, just like the process of learning software engineering.
